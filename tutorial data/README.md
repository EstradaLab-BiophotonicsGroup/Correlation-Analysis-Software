Tutorial data:
In this folder you can find the simulation files I used for the tutorial. 

1) simulationforpcf_2populations_with_a_barrier.b64
   
    This is the simulation for the first tutorial. If you want the program to recongnize the line time, you need to also download the *.jrn file which contains the metadata.

   
2) simulation2channels
 
  This is the simulation for the two channels with bleading tutorial. The file that ends with 1000 is CH1, the one with 2000 is CH2.
